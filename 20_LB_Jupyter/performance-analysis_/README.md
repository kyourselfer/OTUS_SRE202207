performance-analysis
====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jolynch/performance-analysis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jolynch/performance-analysis)

My collection of various ipython notebooks and useful command line scripts for
analyzing performance of all kinds of services and code. I also try to include
useful tools for building or using other tools.

Note that this is not a python package you can install. All the scripts
strive to have as minimal dependencies as possible, and when they do have
dependencies they will list them in a per script `requirements.txt` file.

Getting Started
===============

To get started check out the following directories:
* [Notebooks](notebooks/README.md)
* [CLI scripts](cli/README.md)
