Latency Heatmap
===============

This notebook helps you explore latency data from a number of different
sources. As long as at the end of the day you have times of events and the
duration of that event, you can turn it into a pretty matplotlib based
latency heatmap.

Note that this approach is inspired by Brendan Gregg's
[Latency Heatmaps](http://www.brendangregg.com/HeatMaps/latency.html), but
I wanted them to work in Jupyter Notebooks so I could experiment with the
different kinds of plotting and such.
